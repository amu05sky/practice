# Prime Construction 
# Question -: A math game is introduced in a school competition to test 
# the skills of students. The game deals with Prime numbers.
# The game rules are as follows:

# From the given set of distinct natural numbers as input, consider the smallest natural number as q.
# Your task is to compute the smallest prime number (p) such that when 
# p is divided by all the distinct numbers in the input, except q, should result q as the remainder.
# Constraints :
# 1 < n < 11
# p < 10 ^ 10
# Input :
# Input consists of n+1 number of distinct natural numbers separated by spaces.
 
# Output :
# Print single integer p if such a p exists, else print “None”.
 
# Time Limit : 1 secs

# Example 1 :
# Input :
# 4
# 3 4 5 1
# Output : 61
# Explanation : Here the n+1 numbers are 3, 4, 5 and 1 where q=1 (the least of the numbers)
# The smallest number that leaves remainder 1 when divided by 3, 4 and 5 is 61 and is prime.
# Hence, output is 61.

# Example 2 :
# Input :
# 4
# 3 4 5 2
# Output : None
# Explanation : Here q=2. Any number that when divided by 4 leaving remainder 
# 2 must be an even number e.g., 6, 10, 14 etc. Hence it can’t be prime. Hence, output is “None”.

from math import gcd

# Read input
n = int(input())
v = list(map(int, input().split()))

# Find the minimum value
min_value = min(v)

if min_value % 2 == 0:
    print("none")
else:
    # Calculate LCM
    lcm = v[0]
    for i in range(1, n):
        lcm = (lcm * v[i]) // gcd(lcm, v[i])

    # Calculate and print the result
    result = lcm + min_value
    print(result)
